## Follow instructions to get up & running - simple `git clone` won't work!

## Prerequisites
- Create an AWS (Amazon Web Services) account (https://aws.amazon.com/) <br>
-

## [A] Install AWS Amplify CLI
- Open Terminal, and type `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`

## [B] Configure Amplify & Create Amplify User
- In Terminal, type `amplify configure` -> This will re-direct you to a browser AWS console <br>
- In broswer, log in to AWS <br>
- Then, come back to Terminal, and press Enter <br>
- Select Region <br>
- Specify the username of the new IAM user. **I**dentity and **A**ccess **M**anagement (IAM) user is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or application that uses it to interact with AWS. I will name this user `amplify-auth-user`. Hit Enter, and your browser will open again. <br>
- Make sure to check below settings <br>

- Below step is optional <br>
![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60368973/105080000-11095680-5a45-11eb-9ab0-8ed873102585.png)
- **Download csv file to store Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Password**
![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60368973/105080071-29797100-5a45-11eb-9710-9def600ac737.png)
- Go back to Terminal -> Press Enter to continue <br>
- Paste Access Key ID, Secret Access Key <br>
- Set a profile name (I kept it same as user name, `amplify-auth-user`) <br>
- Our Amplify user has been created! <br>

## [C] Create a New Expo Project

## [D] Initialize AWS Amplify in RN (Expo) Project

## [E] Add & Configure Authentication in RN (Expo) Project

## [F] Install Dependencies

## [G] Run Expo App in Simulator

## [H] Manage User Pools


There are many prerequisites to be installed before we can actually install RN.<br>
Make sure ALL are installed.
- [1] Install **Homebrew**
  - Homebrew is a package manager that let's you install stuff that Apple or Linux didn't need
  - Open Terminal, and paste :
  - ```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"```
  - This will also install **Xcode Command Line Tools** (this step takes a while... 2.5GB)
- [2] Install **Node JS**
  - ```brew install node```
- [3] Install **React Native Client**
  - `sudo npm i -g react-native-cli`
  - `# i for install, -g for global` <br>

To build ios projects under Xcode, we need the following as well (yarn is not a must, but a good to have). 
- [4] Install **CocoaPods**
  - CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.
  - `brew install cocoapods`
  - ~~`sudo gem install cocoapods`~~
- [5] Install **Watchman**
  - React Native uses watchman to detect when you've made code changes and then automatically build and push the update your device without you needing to manually refresh it (live reload).
  - `brew install watchman`
- [6] Install **Yarn**
  - Yarn is a new JavaScript package manager built by Facebook, Google, Exponent and Tilde.
  - `brew install yarn`
  
  
## Clone This Repository
>To do so, first check if Git is installed by `git --version`. <br>
>If nothing shows up, you need to install Xcode, which will also install Git.<br>
>Check if Xcode is installed by `xcode-select -p` <br>
>If directory exists, Xcode is installed. Otherwise, install Xcode from App Store.

From your local machine, open Terminal, and go to (`cd` into) a directory where you would like to copy (clone) this project. <br>
Do NOT create project directory, since `clone` will create a project directory with the name `rn_ble_manager_v2` (name of this repo).

- Paste following : <br>
- `git clone https://github.com/onehwengineer/rn_ble_manager_v2.git`

You will now notice that [your project dir]/rn_ble_manager_v2 is created. <br>


## (Repo Cloned Already) Getting Latest Changes from Remote Repo
> If this repo was cloned before, and you'd like to "get" the latest updates to this repo, follow this step

- In Terminal, `cd` into project directory, /rn_ble_manager_v2
- `git pull origin master` This will get, or "pull" all the latest changes in the remote repo to your local repo.


## Install All Node Libraries/Dependencies in Cloned Project (as specified under packages.json)
- From Terminal, `cd` into /rn_ble_manager_v2
- Type : `npm install`
- Next, `cd` into /ios (a sub-directory of rn_ble_manager_v2), and type `pod install`
- `cd ..` to go back to project directory


## [IMPORTANT] MUST DO THIS STEP
For any apps with react-native-vector-icons library, below steps must be done after cloning. <br>
Otherwise, *failed to build ios project... error code 65* will show up when `react-native run-ios` is run.

- [1] Unlink react-native-vector-icons library
  - `react-native unlink react-native-vector-icons` 
  - `cd ios` -> `pod install` -> `cd ..`
- [2] Install again
  - `npm install --save react-native-vector-icons` **—save** is important here
  - `cd ios` -> `pod install` -> `cd ..`
- [3] Add fonts manuall for ios and android (use your text editor - I use VSCode)
  - [ios] Go to [project name]/ios/[project name]/**info.plist** 
  - Add the fonts BELOW UIAppFonts array 
  ```console
  <key>UIAppFonts</key>
    <array>
      <string>AntDesign.ttf</string>
      <string>Entypo.ttf</string>
      <string>EvilIcons.ttf</string>
      <string>Feather.ttf</string>
      <string>FontAwesome.ttf</string>
      <string>FontAwesome5_Brands.ttf</string>
      <string>FontAwesome5_Regular.ttf</string>
      <string>FontAwesome5_Solid.ttf</string>
      <string>Foundation.ttf</string>
      <string>Ionicons.ttf</string>
      <string>MaterialIcons.ttf</string>
      <string>MaterialCommunityIcons.ttf</string>
      <string>SimpleLineIcons.ttf</string>
      <string>Octicons.ttf</string>
      <string>Zocial.ttf</string>
    </array>
  ```
    - Save -> restart VSCode (or any other text editor) & metro bundler (Terminal)
    - [android] Add this line to android/app/**build.gradle**
    - `apply from: "../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/fonts.gradle"`
    
## Run App on Simulator (just to make sure no errors during build)
- Although the ultimate goal is to lauch this app in an ios device, we still need to test under Simulator to ensure that there are no build errors.
- In Terminal, make sure you are inside the project directory
- Type 'react-native run-ios`
- Note that first build takes a while - be patient

## Run App on Actual Device (iPhone, our final goal!)
> For this step, **make sure to use your PERSONAL laptop/iphone**
- [0] Sign up for Apple Developer account (don't need to pay anything)
  - https://developer.apple.com/
  - Make sure to make this account separate from your personal
- **Connect your iPhone to a Mac via Lightening cable**
- **Double click : .../rn_ble_manager_v2/ios/rn_ble_manager_v2.xcworkspace to launch RN app in Xcode**
- [1] Sign in to Xcode with your developer's account
  - Xcode → Preferences → Accounts tab
![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60368973/103330583-06940800-4a17-11eb-9d2c-927d5b22aabc.png)<br>
- [2] Assign team
  - Select the account name signed in from previous
![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60368973/103330584-08f66200-4a17-11eb-89e6-f074e777dced.png)
- [3] Connect your iPhone to a Mac via Lightening cable
  - In Xcode, hit Windows → Devices and Simulators
  - A window will show up and indicate that this iPhone needs to be trusted
  - Unlock your (connected) iPhone, and hit Trust upon pop up
  - Xcode will then install debugger support on this iPhone (takes a few min)
  - Afterwards, make sure "Show as run destination" is checked  
  - Finally, select your iPhone as the target as shown below
![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60368973/103330585-0a278f00-4a17-11eb-80f8-e23d58af33e8.png)
- [4] Verify Developer App certificate 
  - On your iPhone, click Settings → General → Device Management → Click Trust
- [5] Hit Run button in Xcode!
  - You will get a ton of warning messages, but just ignore them.
  - After a few min, your app will launch on your iPhone!
